# TechNova-2021

For TechNova 2021, we were inspired by the theme "Building the Bridge" to build a bridge between consumers and sustainable fashion. 
Introducing Betterfly, a free Chrome extension that helps solve that issue. Betterfly runs in the background and uses GoodOnYou's rating to
help the user determine the brand ranking of the fashion companies they shop from. It pop ups on the product page to remind the user of the 
raiting and recommends a second-hand alternative or local, sustainable alternative, if available. 

Betterfly makes it easier for consumers to shop more sustainable and think about the impact of each purchase.

The code uses the method created by Ethical Shopper to extract GoodOnYou to retrieve brand information, their ratings, and their respective website URLs.
